# LDA---Topic-Analysis


There are two LDA models and one attempt of K-Means Clustering used in this section. The following code cannot run on its own without skipping some sections

- The LDA section uses classic gensim LDAModel
- The LDA Mallet section uses genim LDAMallet model which is a variation of the first classic LDAModel. LDA Mallet works slightly better in our case here
- For both LDA models, there are sections to loop through different number of topics and find the coherence score. Make sure to skip this after you found an best-fitting value of number of topics
- The last section is using k-means to cluster. Not a lot of attempts are made here. Please feel free to contact me (s326lin@uwaterloo.ca) if anything in this code is not clear
